## 🎯 RETREAT FRAMEWORKS & TOOLS

### IKIGAI DIAGRAM EXERCISE
**Individual Exercise (30 min each):**

Draw four overlapping circles and label them:
1. **What You LOVE** - Your passions
2. **What You're GOOD AT** - Your skills and talents
3. **What You Can Be PAID FOR** - Market demand
4. **What The World NEEDS** - Problems you can solve

Fill in each circle individually, then find the overlaps:
- **Passion** = What you love + What you're good at
- **Mission** = What you love + What the world needs
- **Vocation** = What the world needs + What you can be paid for
- **Profession** = What you're good at + What you can be paid for
- **IKIGAI** = The center where all four intersect

**Partnership Exercise (30 min together):**
Create a combined Ikigai showing where your individual diagrams overlap. This reveals your partnership's sweet spot.
