# Shared Workspace Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Ashlyn Retreat app now supports a **shared Firebase workspace** for business tools while keeping journals and personal data private. API keys have also been secured and removed from the git repository.

## What Changed

### 1. Security Improvements ✅

**API Keys Removed from Git:**
- `js/firebase-config.js` - Now in .gitignore (contains Firebase API keys)
- `js/gemini-config.js` - Now in .gitignore (Gemini API config)
- Both files remain on your local machine but won't be pushed to GitHub

**Action Required:**
- Keep your local copies of these files
- Other developers/users must create their own from the `.example.js` versions

### 2. Dual Workspace Structure ✅

**User Workspace (Private):**
- Location: `users/{userId}/userData`
- Contains personal data:
  - `ashlyn_retreat_dillyn_journals` - Dillyn's journals
  - `ashlyn_retreat_ashlee_journals` - Ashlee's journals
  - `ashlyn_retreat_preferences` - User preferences
- Only the owner can read/write

**Shared Workspace (Collaborative):**
- Location: `shared/ashlyn_retreat`
- Contains business tools:
  - `ashlyn_retreat_supplies` - Supply checklist
  - `ashlyn_retreat_swot` - SWOT analyses
  - `ashlyn_retreat_ikigai` - Ikigai diagram
  - `ashlyn_retreat_value_prop` - Value proposition canvas
  - `ashlyn_retreat_kanban` - Kanban board
  - `ashlyn_retreat_action_plan` - 90-day action plan
- Both retreat participants can read/write
- Tracks who made last update with `updatedBy` field

## How It Works

### Automatic Routing
The app automatically determines where to save data:
```javascript
// Shared data keys are defined in firebase.js
sharedDataKeys: [
    'ashlyn_retreat_supplies',
    'ashlyn_retreat_swot',
    'ashlyn_retreat_ikigai',
    'ashlyn_retreat_value_prop',
    'ashlyn_retreat_kanban',
    'ashlyn_retreat_action_plan'
]

// When saving:
if (isSharedData(key)) {
    // Save to shared/ashlyn_retreat/{key}
} else {
    // Save to users/{userId}/userData/{key}
}
```

### Real-Time Sync
- When one user updates a business tool, the other sees it immediately
- Journals remain private - no cross-user visibility
- Console logs show "Saved to shared workspace" or "Saved to user workspace"

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Deploy Firebase Security Rules
See `FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES.md` for complete instructions:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Realtime Database → Rules
2. Copy the security rules from the document
3. Paste and publish

### Step 2: Migrate Existing Data
1. Log in to the app
2. Look for the sync status bar at the bottom
3. Click the "Migrate to Shared" button
4. Confirm the migration
5. Wait for completion message

The migration:
- Moves business tools from your user workspace to shared workspace
- Keeps journals in your private workspace
- Safe to run multiple times
- Shows which keys were migrated

### Step 3: Both Users Access
After migration:
- Both Dillyn and Ashlee can log in
- Business tools are now shared
- Updates from either user appear for both
- Journals remain private to each user

## Benefits

### Collaboration
- Work on business planning together in real-time
- Share supply checklist - both can check items off
- Collaborate on Kanban board without duplicating work
- See each other's contributions to SWOT, Ikigai, etc.

### Privacy
- Journals remain completely private
- Each user only sees their own reflections
- Letters to future self are private
- Daily reflections are private

### Transparency
- `updatedBy` field shows who made the last change
- Timestamp shows when it was updated
- Both users can see the complete history

```

### Code Changes
- **firebase.js**: Added workspace routing logic
- **firebase-auth-handlers.js**: Added migration button handler
- **index.html**: Added migration button to sync bar
- **.gitignore**: Added config files to prevent API key exposure

## Testing Checklist

After deploying:
- [ ] Log in as first user
- [ ] Click "Migrate to Shared" button
- [ ] Verify migration success message
- [ ] Update a business tool (e.g., add Kanban card)
- [ ] Log in as second user
- [ ] Verify business tool shows the update
- [ ] Check that journals are NOT shared
- [ ] Verify console shows correct workspace routing

## Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated" Error
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check Firebase console that authentication is enabled

### Migration Fails
- Check Firebase security rules are deployed
- Verify you have write permissions
- Check browser console for errors

### Data Not Syncing
- Check internet connection
- Look for sync status bar at bottom
- Verify Firebase is enabled in config
- Check console logs for sync messages

### Can't See Other User's Changes
- Both users must be authenticated
- Check Firebase security rules allow shared access
- Verify data is in `shared/ashlyn_retreat` not user workspace

## Files Modified

1. `.gitignore` - Added config files
2. `js/firebase.js` - Added shared workspace logic
3. `js/firebase-auth-handlers.js` - Added migration handler
4. `index.html` - Added migration button
5. `FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES.md` - New documentation
6. `SHARED_WORKSPACE_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Security Rules** - Copy from FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES.md
2. **Test Migration** - Run migration as first user
3. **Verify Sharing** - Test with second user account
4. **Monitor Console** - Check logs show correct routing
5. **Collaborate** - Start using shared business tools together!
